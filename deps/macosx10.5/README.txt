========================================================================


Here you will find packages for Python 2.7 and Pygame 1.9.1.  First
install the Python package, and then install the Pygame package.

Please note that the Pygame package supplied is not compatible with the
version of Python supplied with Mac OS X.

I do not have access to any Macs, so I have not personally tested this.
I also have no experience with Mac OS X, so I do not know exactly what
the installation procedure is.  However, it should work.  Please let me
know if it doesn't.
