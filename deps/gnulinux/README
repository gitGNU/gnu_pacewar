For most GNU/Linux distributions, the proper way to install Python and
Pygame is through the package manager.  This is what you should be
doing.  In Debian and its derivatives (such as Ubuntu and Mint), the
packages needed are "python" and "python-pygame".  In Fedora, the
packages needed are "python" and "pygame".  In Arch, the packages
needed are "python2" and "python2-pygame".

In almost all cases, a version of Python will already be available, and
this will usually be Python 2.

If you do not have any of the distros listed above and can't figure out
what packages to install, or if you're just a rebel, you can compile
Pygame yourself.  The source code to a version of Pygame which should
work is included here.  Make sure the "dev" or "devel" packages for SDL,
SDL_mixer, and SDL_image are installed, then open the directory
containing the Pygame source code and run "python2 setup.py install" as
root.
